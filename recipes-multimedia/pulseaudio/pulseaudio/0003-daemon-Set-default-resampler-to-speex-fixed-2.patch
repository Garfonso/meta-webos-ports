+# speex-float-3 is arguably too heavy resampler to be the default.
+# Ubuntu, for example, patches this to speex-float-2. Mer is targeted
+# at mobile devices, and speex-float-2 may still be a bit too heavy
+# for that purpose. Ideally the default resampler would be decided by
+# hardware adaptations, but for now we patch this in Mer.
+#
+# Why ffmpeg, why not e.g. speex-fixed-1? I don't know, I'm not aware
+# of the history of that decision. If you think something else would
+# be better, feel free to change this (and document the rationale
+# here).
+#
+# Changed from ffmpeg to speex-fixed-2 due to ffmpeg producing broken
+# audio data in some cases (mono samples). No good other rationale
+# for choosing the resampling method as of yet. Benchmarking different
+# resamplers would be a good starting point to decide properly.
